# Inheritance

    public void eat() {
        super.eat(); // animal eat() method iig gej duudaj bolno
    }
}

# Reference vs Object vs Instance vs Class
* Let's use analogy of building a house to understand Classes
* A class is basically a blueprint for a house, using blueprint (plans) we can build as many houses
* Each house you build (in other words instantiate using the new operator) is an object also known as an instance.
* Each house you build has an address. This is known as a reference
* You can copy that reference as many times as you like but there is still just one house, In other words we are copying the paper that has address on it not the house itself.
* We can pass references as parameters to constructors and methods

* Main дээрээс House blueHouse = new House("blue") - create instance object in memory

## reference
Нэг reference тэй. 2 reference 1 object
```
blue   another
|      /
|     /
Object type: House
Color: yellow

House blueHouse = new House("blue")
House anotherHouse = blueHouse;
anotherHouse.setColor("yellow")

println(blueHouse.getColor()); // yellow
println(anotherHouse.getColor()); // yellow

```

## this vs super
* super is used to access/call the parent class members(variables and methods)
* this is used to call the current class members (variables and methods)
* this is commonly used with constructors and setters
* super is commonly used with method overriding super.printMethod()


## good constructor 1 -> 2 -> 3
* no mather what constructor we call, the variables will always be initialized in 3rd constructor
```
// 1st
public Rectangle() {
    this(0, 0); // calls 2nd constuctor
}

// 2nd
public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
    this(0, 0, width, height) // calls 3rd consturctor
}

// 3rd
public Rectangel( int x, int y, int width, int height) {
    // initialize variables
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
}
```

## Method overriding vs overloading
* overloading means providing two or more separate methods in a class with the same name but different parameters
* return type may or may not be different and reuse the same method name
* overloading is very handy, it reduces duplicated code
* overlaoding does not have anythong to do with polymorphism but java developers often refer to overloading as Compile Time Polymorhism.
* we can overload static and instance methods
* usually overloading happens inside a single class, but a method can also be treated as overloaded in the subclass of that class.
* sublcass inherits
* overloading both following rules:
    * Methods must have the same method name
    * Methods must have different parameters.
* they may or may not
    * Have different return types.
    * Have different access modifiers.
    * Throw different checked or unchecked exceptions
* return type may be different.

Method Overriding
* Method overriding means defining a method in a child class that already exists in the parent class with same signature(same name, same arguments)
* By extending the parent class the child class
* Method overriding is also known as Runtime Polymorphism and Dynamic Method Dispatch, because the method that is going to be called is decided at runtime by the JVM.
* @Override - annotation
* We can't override static methods only instance methods.
* Rules
    * must have same name and same arguments.
    * return type can be a subclass of the return type in the parent class
    * It can't have a lower access modifier.
    * For example if the parent method is protected then using private in the child is not allowed but using public in the child would be allowed.
* Only inherited methods can be overridden, in other words methods can be overridden only in child classes.
* Constructors and private methods cannot be overridden.
* Methods that are final cannot be overridden.
* A subclass can use super.methodName() to call the superclass version of an overridden method.
* return type must be same.

## static vs instance methods
* static methods are declared using a static modifier.
* static methods can't access instance methods and instance variables directly.
* they are usually used for operations that don't required any data from an instance of the class(from 'this')
* if you remember, the this keyword is the current instance of a class.
* in static methods we can't use the this keyword
* doen't use instance variables that method should be declared as a static method.
* for example main is a static method and it is called by the JVM when it starts an application.
```
// static methods are called as ClassName.methodName(); or methodName; only if in the same class
class Calculator {
    public static void printSum( int a, int b) {
        // print a + b
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator.printSum(5, 10);
        printHello(); // shorter form of main.printHello();
    }

    public static void printHello() {
        // print Hello
    }
}

```



Instance methods
* Instance methods belong to an instance of a class.
* to use an instance method we have to instantiate the class first usually by using the new keyword.
* instance methods can access instance methods and instance variables directly.
* instance methods can also access static methods and static variables directly.
```
class Dog {
    public void bark() {
        // print "woof"
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog rex = new Dog(); // create instance
        rex.bark(); // call instance method
    }
}
```

* Should a method be static? ->
* Does it use any fields (instance bariables) or instance methods? ->
* Yes -> it should probably be an instance method
* No -> it should probably be a static method

## Static vs Instance variables
