# Inner and abstract classes and interfaces

## Interfaces
An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to describe a behavior that classes must implement. They are similar to protocols. Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword, and may only contain method signature and constant declarations (variable declarations that are declared to be both static and final).

```
public interface ITelephone {
    void powerOn();
    void dial(int phoneNumber);
    void answer();
    boolean callPhone(int phoneNumber);
    boolean isRinging();
}

public class DeskPhone implements ITelephone {

    private int myNumber;
    private boolean isRinging;

    public DeskPhone(int myNumber) {
        this.myNumber = myNumber;
    }

    @Override
    public void powerOn() {
        System.out.println("No action taken, desk phone does not have a power button");

    }

    @Override
    public void dial(int phoneNumber) {
        System.out.println("Now ringing " + phoneNumber + " on deskphone");

    }

    @Override
    public void answer() {
        if(isRinging) {
            System.out.println("Answering the desk phone");
            isRinging = false;
        }

    }

    @Override
    public boolean callPhone(int phoneNumber) {
        if(phoneNumber == myNumber) {
            isRinging = true;
            System.out.println("Ring ring");
        } else {
            isRinging = false;
        }

        return isRinging;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isRinging() {
        return isRinging;
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ITelephone timsPhone;
        timsPhone = new DeskPhone(123456);
        timsPhone.powerOn();
        timsPhone.callPhone(123456);
        timsPhone.answer();
    }
}



```

## Inner Classes
```
Gearbox mcLaren = new Gearbox(6);
Gearbox.Gear first = mcLaren.new Gear(1, 12.3);
// Gearbox.Gear second = new  Gearbox.Gear(1, 12.3); // this not work
// Gearbox.Gear third = new  mcLaren.Gear(1, 12.3); // this not work
```

## Abstract Classes
different from interface. Have extends, data type
```
public abstract class Animal {
    private String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void eat();
    public abstract void breathe();

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("is eating");
    }
}

Dog dog = new Dog("Yorkie");
dog.eat();
```

```
// iim bichilt bj boloh yum bna.
public asbract class Bird extends Animal implements CanFly {
    public Bird(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
}
```

## Interface vs Abstract class
Abstract class
* Abstract classes are similar to Interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation.

* However, with Abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods.

* An Abstract class can extend only one parent class but it can implement multiple interfaces.

* When an Abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class.

* However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.

## Use an Abstract class when ..
* You want to share code among several closely related classes (Animal - with fields name, age...)

* You expect classes that extend your abstract class to have many common methods or fields or required access modifiers other than public (protected, private)

* You want to declare non static or non final fields (for example name, age), this enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of an object (getName, setName).

* When you have a requirement for your base class to provide a default implementation of certain methods but other methods should be open to being overriden by child classes.

* Summary: The purpose of an Abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.

## Interface
* An interface is just the declaration of methods of an Class, it's not the implementation.

* In an interface, we define what kind of operation an object can perform. These operations are defined by the classes that classes that implement the interface.

* Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler.

* You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. All methods in interfaces are automatically public and abstract.

* An interface can extend another interface.

* Interfaces are more flexible and can deal with a lot more stress on the design of your program than the implementation.
* By introducing interfaces into you program, you are really introduce points of variation at which you can plug in different implementations for that interface. An interfaces primary purpose is abstraction, decoupling the "what" from the "how".
* NOTE: Since Java 8 interfaces can contain default methods. In other words methods with implementation. The keyword default is used (mostly for backwards compatibility), and static methods as well before Java 8 that was not possible.
* NOTE: Since Java 9 an interface can also contain private methods (commonly used when two default methods in an Interface share common code).

## Use an Interface when...
* You expect that unrelated classes will implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes.
* You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but you are not concerned about who implements its behavior.
* You want to separate different behavior.
* The Collections API is an excellent example, we have the List interface and implementations ArrayList and LinkedList(more on that later in the course).
* The JDBC API is another excellent example. It exist of almost only interfaces. The concrete implementations are provided as "JDBC drivers". This enables you to write all the JDBC code independent of the database(DB) vendor. You will learn more about JDBC later in the course.
