# Naming Conventions and Packages. static and final keywords

## Java Naming Convention
* Adopting the accepted conventions for naming variables, methods and objects in java makes your code easier for others to read.

* "Others" here also includes you when you come to look at your code weeks of months after you wrote it.

## Packages
The things you will name in java are:
* Packages
* Classes
* Interfaces
* Methods
* Constants
* Variables
* Type Parameters

* Always lower case.
* Package names should be unique
* Use your internet domain name, reversed, as a prefix for the package name.
* Oracle specify a convention for package names at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se6/html/packages.html#7

## invalid domain name components
* replace invalid characters (i.e. -) in domain name with an underscore.  
Switch.supplier.com -> com.supplier._switch

* Domain name components starting with a number should instead start with an underscore.
1world.com -> com._1world

* Domain name components that are java keywords should have that component start with an underscore.
Experts-exchange.com -> com.experts_exchange

## Class names
* CamelCase
* Class names should be nouns (they represent things)
* Should start with a capital letter
* Each word in the name should also start with a capital (e.g. LinkedList)
* ArrayList, String, TopSong, GearBox, Main

## Interface names
* Capitalized like class names (CamelCase)
* Consider what objects implementing the interface will become of what they will be able to do. Example. List, Comparable, Serializeable

## method names
* mixedCase.
* Often verbs
* Reflect the function performed or the result returned. Example: size(), getName(), addPlayer()

## constats
* ALL UPPER_CASE
* separate words with underscore.
* Declared using the final keyword
* static final int MAX_INT
* static final short SEVERITY_ERROR
* static final double P1 = 3.1415

## Variable names
* mixedCase
* Meaningful and indicative.
* Start with lower case letter.
* Do not use underscores _.
Example: i, league, boxLength

## Type Parameters Examples
* E - element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
* K - key
* T - type
* V - value
* S, U, V, etc = 2nd 3rd, 4th types

# Scope
scope actually refers to the visibility of a class, member, or variable.
