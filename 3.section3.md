public is an access modifier

static is a java keyword that needs an understanding of other concepts, for now, know that we need to have static for java to find our method to run the code we are going to add.

void is yet another java keyword used to indicate that the method will not return anything - more on that later.

```
public class Hello { 
  public class static void main(String[] args) { } 
}
```

What are variables?
-------------------
Variables are a way to store information on our computers. Variables that we define in a program can be accessed by a name we give them, and the computer does the hard work of figuring out where they get stored in the computer's random access memory (RAM).

A variable, as the name suggests can be changed, in other words, its contents are variable.

What we have to do is tell the computer what type of information we want to store in the variable, and then give it a name.

There are lots of different types of data we can define for our variables. Collectively these are known as Data types. As you may have guessed, data types are keywords in java.

Let's start out by defining a variable of type int - int being an abbreviation for integer, a whole number (that is a number without any decimal points).

To define a variable we need to specify the data type, then give our variable a name, and optionally add an expression to initialize the variable with a value.

Declaration Statement
---------------------
Used to define a variable by indicating the data type, and the name, and optionally to set the variable to a certain value.
int myFirstNumber = 5;
Here the type (short for Data type) is an int, the name is myFirstNumber and the value we are assigning or initializing our variable with is 5. We are declaring a variable of type int with the name myFirstNumber and assigning the value 5 to it.

Expression
----------
This is a construct that evaluates to a single value - we'll discuss this in much more detail in the upcoming section on expressions.

Java operators
--------------
Java operators or just operators perform an operation (hence the world) on a variable or value. +, -, / and * are four common ones that I feel sure you are familiar with.
There are lots more you will learn as we go through the course.

Primitive Types
---------------
In Java primitive types are the most basic data types. The INT is one of eight primitive types.
The eight primitive data types in Java are BOOLEAN, BYTE, CHAR, SHORT, INT, LONG, FLOAT and DOUBLE. Consider these types as the building blocks of data manipulation. Let's explore the eight primitive types in Java.

java packages
-------------
A package is a way to organize your java projects.

Wrapper classes
---------------
Java uses the concept of a Wrapper class for all eight primitive types - In the case of an int, we can use Integer, and by doing that it gives us ways to perform operations on an int.
```
int myMinIntValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // -2147483648
int myMaxIntValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // 2147483647

// overflow and underflow
myMaxIntVlaue + 1 => // -2147483648    - Busted Max value

byte myMinByteValue = Byte.MIN_VALUE; // -128
byte myMaxByteValue = Byte.MAX_VALUE; // 127

short myMinShortValue = Short.MIN_VALUE; // -32768
short myMaxShortValue = Short.MAX_VALUE; // 32767

long myMinLongValue = Long.MIN_VALUE; // -
long myMaxLongValue = Long.MAX_VALUE; //
```

Creating Wrapper Objects
------------------------
Томоор бичнэ. Class ууд юм.
To create a wrapper object, use the wrapper class instead of the primitive type. To get the value, you can just print the object:
```
Integer myInt = 5;
Double myDouble = 5.99;
Character myChar = 'A';
```

Since you're now working with objects, you can use certain methods to get information about the specific object.
For example, the following methods are used to get the value associated with the corresponding wrapper object: intValue(), byteValue(), shortValue(), longValue(), floatValue(), doubleValue(), charValue(), booleanValue().

System.out.println(myInt.intValue());
System.out.println(myDouble.doubleValue());
System.out.println(myChar.charValue());

Another useful method is the toString() method, which is used to convert wrapper objects to strings.
In the following example, we convert an Integer to a String, and use the length() method of the String class to output the length of the "string":
Integer myInt = 100;
String myString = myInt.toString();
System.out.println(myString.length());

Size of Primitive Types and Width
---------------------------------
A byte occupies 8 bits. width of 8
A short occupies 16 bits. width of 16
An int occupies 32 bits. width of 32

Casting in java
---------------
Casting means to treat or convert a number from one type to another. We put the type we want the number to be in parenthesis like this:

byte myNewByte = (byte) (myMinByteValue/2);

Floating Point Numbers
----------------------
Unlike whole numbers, floating-point numbers have fractional parts that we express with a decimal point. 3.14159 is an example.

Floating-point numbers are also known as real numbers. We use a floating point number when we need more precision in calculations.

Single and Double Precision (нарийвчлал)
----------------------------------------
Precision refers to the format and amount of space occupied by the type. Single precision occupies 32 bits (width of 32) and a Double precision occupies 64 bits (width of 64)
As a result the float has a range from 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E+38
double is 4.9E-324 to 1.7...E + 308

float myMinFloatVlaue = Float.MIN_VALUE;
float myMaxFloatVlaue = Float.MAX_VALUE;

double myMin = Double.MIN_VALUE;

int m = 5;
float mf = 5.25f;
float mf = (float) 5.25;
double myd = 5.25d;

Char Data type
--------------
A char occupies two bytes of memory, or 16 bits and thus has a width of 16. The reason it's not just a single byte is that it allows you to store Unicode characters.

Unicode is an international encoding standard for use with different languages and scripts, by which each letter, digit, or symbol is assigned a unique numeric value that applies across different platforms and programs.

two bytes that a char takes up in memory it can represent and one of 65535 different types of characters.

char myChar = 'D';
char myUnicode = '\u0044';

Boolean Primitive Type
----------------------
A boolean value allows for tow choices True or False, Yes or No, 1 or 0.

String
------
The String is a datatype in java, which is not a primitive type. It's actually a Class, 
A String is a sequence of char. it could contain a single character only (regular character or Unicode character).
A String can contain a sequence of characters. A large number of characters. Technically it's limited by memory or the MAX_VALUE of an int which was 2.14 Billion. That's a lot of characters.

String myString = "This is a string";
String lastStr = "10"
int myInt = 50;
lastStr = lastStr + myInt; // 1050

! Strings in Java are Immutable
When I said you can delete characters out of a String, that's not strictly true. Because Strings in Java are immutable. That means you can't change a String after it's created. Instead, what happens is a new String is created.

lastStr doesn't get appended the value 1050 instead a new String is created which consists of the previous value of lastStr plus a text representation of the int value 1050.

The code we used to append Strings was inefficient.

What are Operators?
What is an Operand? 
int myVar = 15 + 12;
+ - operator
15 and 12 - operand

What is an Expression? 
An expression is formed by combining variables, literals, method return values (which we haven't covered yet) and operators.
int myValue = 15 + 12 -> is the expression which has (or return) 27 in this case.

Abbreviating operators
----------------------
```
i++;
i += 2;
```
